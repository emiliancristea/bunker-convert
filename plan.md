# Bunker-convert Product Plan

## Vision & Differentiation
Bunker-convert is a modern, modular, GPU-accelerated media transformer that outclasses ImageMagick convert by prioritizing speed, composability, reproducibility, and developer ergonomics. ImageMagick remains the gold standard for breadth of formats and CLI versatility, but its order-sensitive syntax and CPU-bound pipeline slow down high-resolution and batch workflows.

### Differentiation Highlights
| Area | ImageMagick convert | Bunker-convert (proposed) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Processing core | CPU-centric, legacy CLI semantics | GPU-first pipeline with CPU fallback (CUDA/Metal/Vulkan), SIMD/AVX |
| Syntax & DX | Order-sensitive flags, steep learning curve | Declarative pipeline with explicit stages, YAML/JSON job specs, stable CLI |
| Reproducibility | Manual scripts, env-dependent | Versioned recipes, lockfiles, deterministic runs |
| Extensibility | Many built-ins, monolithic | Plugin system with WASM-native filters, safe sandboxing |
| Batch & parallelism | Possible, manual orchestration | Auto-chunking, adaptive parallelism, resumable jobs, checkpointing |
| Formats | 200+ image formats | Images first, plus video/audio/doc via modular codecs; curated, auditable sets |
| Observability | Minimal | Structured logs, metrics, traces, diff previews, quality gates |
| Security | Native libs with mixed licensing | Strictly audited codecs, SBOM, signature-verifiable builds |

## Personas & Use Cases
- **Production media pipelines:** High-volume asset preparation for e-commerce, marketing, and publishing teams demanding reproducible outputs and GPU acceleration.
- **Creative automation teams:** Agencies and studios orchestrating multi-step creative effects that benefit from declarative stage definitions and checkpointing.
- **Developer tooling & integration:** Platform teams embedding conversion capabilities into internal services, requiring SDK parity across languages and deterministic outcomes.

## Success Metrics
- 2–10× throughput improvement on 4K image batches compared to ImageMagick convert.
- <0.1% divergence between repeated runs of identical recipes across supported platforms.
- 95% recipe validation pass rate before execution with actionable diagnostics.
- 90th percentile job latency under 30 seconds for representative production workloads.
- Zero critical security advisories outstanding at GA release.

## Architecture Overview

### Pipeline Engine
- Graph-based pipeline where each node is a stage (decode → transform(s) → encode) with typed inputs/outputs.
- Deterministic stage execution via pinned versions, schema-validated parameters, and immutable data flow.
- Stage-level retries, fallbacks, and checkpointing to isolate failures and enable resumable runs.

### Acceleration & Scheduling
- GPU execution layers for CUDA (NVIDIA), Metal (macOS), and Vulkan/DirectCompute (cross-platform), with CPU parity as fallback.
- CPU optimization through AVX2/AVX-512, multithreading, cache-aware memory layout, and zero-copy buffers.
- Heuristic scheduler that selects GPU or CPU per stage based on data size, device load, and effect complexity with telemetry feedback loops.

### Codec & Filter Modules
- Core codec pack covering PNG, JPEG, WebP, AVIF, TIFF with optional extensions for video (H.264/H.265, VP9, AV1) and audio (WAV, FLAC).
- Built-in filters for resize, crop, rotate, sharpen, denoise, color adjustments, watermarking, and typography.
- WASM plugin ABI that sandboxes third-party filters with capability-based permissions and resource quotas.

## Spec & Recipe System
- Declarative YAML/JSON job specs describing sources, stages, outputs, and quality gates.
- Lockfiles capturing exact module versions, parameter hashes, and device requirements to guarantee reproducibility.
- Templating with variables, conditionals, and macros for dynamic batch generation.
- CLI and SDK (Python, Node.js, PowerShell) share identical pipeline semantics.

## Observability & QA
- Structured JSON logs with stage timings, device utilization, scheduling decisions, and checkpoint events.
- Prometheus-compatible metrics exporting throughput, latency, error rates, GPU utilization, and retry counts.
- Quality gates enforcing SSIM/PSNR thresholds, file size limits, and color profile constraints with fail-fast behavior.
- Diff previews (image/video + metrics) stored alongside outputs for regression auditing.

## Feature Pillars

### Declarative Pipelines
- Named stages with explicit inputs/outputs eliminate ambiguous flag ordering.
- Recipes are human-readable, reviewable artifacts that can be version-controlled and code-reviewed.

### Batch Mastery
- Auto-chunking splits large jobs by complexity and merges results deterministically.
- Resumable runs leverage checkpointing to restart only failed shards.
- Diff previews quantify output changes before promoting results downstream.

### Performance & Fidelity
- Smart resampling strategies (Lanczos/Mitchell/nearest) selected per content heuristics.
- Adaptive sharpening tuned to edge density and content profile.
- Robust color management with ICC preservation and explicit transform controls.

### Security & Compliance
- SBOM and signed binaries distributed with every release.
- Audited codec provenance and tamper checks to maintain trusted supply chain.
- Sandboxed plugins with capability-based permissions and mandatory review before distribution.

### Developer Ergonomics
- CLI, Python, Node.js, and PowerShell interfaces expose identical command semantics.
- Dry-run mode validates recipes, benchmarks device plans, and estimates resource usage without executing transformations.
- Preset packs for targeted workflows (web, print, archive, social) with tunable constraints.

## Operational Considerations
- **Team roles:** Pipeline (engine, schemas), Acceleration (GPU/CPU optimization), DX (CLI/SDK), Observability (metrics, QA), Security (supply chain, SBOM).
